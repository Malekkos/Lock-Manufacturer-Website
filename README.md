  <summary>Home/Lockpage</summary>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add a body to the lock<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add combinations keys onto the lock that work like a seamless drag carousel<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should probably add some contact information on the bottom of the lock to reach out to me, AKA socials. Should look up some font style that'll make it look engraved, or maybe give the font some sort of like indent to look scratched in?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The body of the lock could be a copper color, I should look up if I can make it have like the kind of streaked body it has, reference this: https://masterlocks.com/products/1up

    REFERENCE: https://sass-lang.com/documentation/style-rules/parent-selector/<br />
    Super cool ideas with the parent selector. Maybe when you hover an carousel item, can change the parent element to be like a transition or something and have a neat little animation run<br />
    For instance, hover a normal item and change the border of the parent to be a different color. Then, when you hover the on-sale item or what ever it will be called, you could have the parent element actually like do a cool animation of it moving something.
